# rendr

_rendr_ is a scaffolding tool which allows generating entire projects (or
anything else) from blueprints, using standard templating engines and simple
customization via parameters. It is generic enough to apply to a wide variety
of applications and tech stacks, but powerful and flexible enough to provide
value, fast. The tool itself is really a generic template renderer. It's up to
you, the template creator, to decide what to put in your template.

### Use cases

Here are just a few possible use cases:

* Enable rapid spin-up of new projects, complete with CI/CD pipelines, code quality gates, security analysis, and more
* Ship "Hello, World!" projects immediately to production, enabling instant iteration on features
* Include CI/CD standards baked into projects from the start, easily kept up to date
* Simplify repeated patterns like creating new microservices, libraries, or submodules on an existing project

## Contributing

Feedback and pull requests are welcome! Let us know if you have issues using
the tool, or see use cases that are not yet supported. We'd love to expand its
usefulness!
