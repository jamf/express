Check out the [User Guide](https://jamf.github.io/rendr/) for the full documentation.

This project is currently under heavy development. The API is expected to change before reaching a 1.0.0 release. That said, it is functional and useful already! Try it out and provide any feedback you have by [opening an issue](https://github.com/jamf/rendr/issues).

## Features

_rendr_ is a scaffolding tool which allows generating entire projects (or anything else) from blueprints, using standard templating engines and simple customization via parameters. It is generic enough to apply to a wide variety of applications and tech stacks, but powerful and flexible enough to provide value, fast. The tool itself is really a generic template renderer. It's up to you, the template creator, to decide what to put in your template.

### Use cases

Here are just a few possible use cases:

* Enable rapid spin-up of new projects, complete with CI/CD pipelines, code quality gates, security analysis, and more
* Ship "Hello, World!" projects immediately to production, enabling instant iteration on features
* Include CI/CD standards baked into projects from the start, easily kept up to date
* Simplify repeated patterns like creating new microservices, libraries, or submodules on an existing project

## Installation

Install the CLI via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```sh
brew install jamf/tap/rendr
```
Alternatively, download the CLI binary directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/jamf/rendr/releases) page and put it on your system path.

## Usage

More detailed usage can be found [in the User Guide](https://jamf.github.io/rendr/usage.html).

View available commands:
```sh
‚ùØ rendr help
```

The basic usage to generate a project looks like this:
```sh
rendr init my-project --blueprint https://github.com/your/template
```

Provide values to the template with the `-v` flag:
```sh
rendr init my-project -b https://github.com/your/template -v name:foo -v version:1.0.0
```
