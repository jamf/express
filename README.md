Check out the [User Guide](https://jamf.github.io/rendr/) for the full documentation.

This project is currently under heavy development. The API is expected to change before reaching a 1.0.0 release. That said, it is functional and useful already! Try it out and provide any feedback you have by [opening an issue](https://github.com/jamf/rendr/issues).

## Features

_rendr_ is a scaffolding tool which allows generating entire projects (or anything else) from blueprints, using standard templating engines and simple customization via parameters. It is generic enough to apply to a wide variety of applications and tech stacks, but powerful and flexible enough to provide value, fast. The tool itself is really a generic template renderer. It's up to you, the template creator, to decide what to put in your template.

### Use cases

Here are just a few possible use cases:

* Enable rapid spin-up of new projects, complete with CI/CD pipelines, code quality gates, security analysis, and more
* Ship "Hello, World!" projects immediately to production, enabling instant iteration on features
* Include CI/CD standards baked into projects from the start, easily kept up to date
* Simplify repeated patterns like creating new microservices, libraries, or submodules on an existing project

### Sample blueprints

Check out the sample blueprints to get a feel for what is possible:
* https://github.com/jamf/rendr-sample-blueprint-hello-world
* https://github.com/jamf/rendr-sample-blueprint-go-microservice

Creating your own blueprint is easy! The details are documented in the [User Guide](https://jamf.github.io/rendr/).
